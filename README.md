===========================================================

Subproject: TrackYou
====================

This is one half of the system for the Glasgow Gritting project.
PHP server-side scripts do data processing of XML files generated by the 
Glasgow City Council's "TrackYou" GPS tracking system http://www.trackyou.co.uk

The source XML files are in a format that only Glasgow Council will have as 
TrackYou wrote a system specifically for the council to generate these files.

The scripts in this repository generate CSV, RSS and KML files from the TrackYou 
XML data for the open data download archives.

For more details and links to the downloadable data see
